# This is a script to automatically mute the computer and pause music when headphones are unplugged.
# It uses pactl and playerctl to control the volume and pause/unpause the music. Make sure to install
# playerctl first using: `sudo apt install playerctl`.

# This should be run on startup, first add auto-mute to your PATH and then
# create `auto-mute.desktop` in ~/.config/autostart/ and add the following
# to the file:
# [Desktop Entry]
# Type=Application
# Exec=auto-mute
# Hidden=false
# NoDisplay=false
# X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
# Name[en_US]=Auto Mute
# Name=Auto Mute
# Comment[en_US]=toggle headphone mute when plugged or unplugged
# Comment=toggle headphone mute when plugged or unplugged
